🛠 Bug Fixes Report – Lead Capture App
📌 Overview

This document provides a summary of the major issues identified and resolved in the Lead Capture Application, which is developed using React, TypeScript, Vite, and Supabase Edge Functions.

🔑 Key Fixes Implemented
1. Undefined .replace() Error in Edge Function

File: supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts
Severity: Critical
Status: ✅ Resolved

Problem
The Edge Function returned a 500 error whenever .replace() was called on an undefined value:

${personalizedContent.replace(/\n/g, '<br>')}


Cause

personalizedContent could be undefined if the OpenAI API returned unexpected data.

No validation before using .replace().

Missing fallback message in case AI generation failed.

Fix
Added validation with a fallback message and a [Your Name] → Deviotech replacement:

${personalizedContent 
  ? personalizedContent.replace(/\n/g, '<br>').replace("[Your Name]", "Deviotech") 
  : 'Welcome to our innovation community!'}


Impact

✅ Prevented Edge Function from crashing

✅ Guaranteed a valid email response even if AI fails

✅ Increased reliability of lead confirmation emails

2. Incorrect OpenAI Response Parsing

File: supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts
Severity: High
Status: ✅ Resolved

Problem
The wrong array index was used when parsing the AI response:

return data?.choices[1]?.message?.content; // ❌ Wrong


Fix
Corrected to the proper index:

return data?.choices[0]?.message?.content; // ✅ Correct


Impact

✅ Correctly retrieves AI-generated content

✅ Personalized messages now display as intended

3. Duplicate Calls to Edge Function

File: src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx
Severity: High
Status: ✅ Resolved

Problem
The send-confirmation function was triggered twice during form submission, resulting in:

Duplicate emails

Unnecessary API costs

Possible user confusion

Fix
Removed duplicate request logic and kept only one call with proper error handling.

Impact

✅ Only one confirmation email per submission

✅ Cleaner code and lower API usage

✅ Better user experience

4. Insufficient Error Handling in Lead Store

File: src/lib/lead-store.ts
Severity: Medium
Status: ✅ Resolved

Problem
The Zustand store lacked error states, validation, and loading indicators.

Fix

Introduced error and loading state management

Added data validation checks

Prevented duplicate email submissions

Wrapped actions with try-catch for safer execution

Impact

✅ Stronger error handling

✅ Smooth UX with loading states

✅ Reliable data handling

5. Industry Field Missing in Lead Model

File: src/lib/lead-store.ts
Severity: Medium
Status: ✅ Resolved

Problem
The Lead interface didn’t include the industry field, leading to incomplete lead data.

Fix
Updated the interface:

interface Lead {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  industry: string; // ✅ Added
}


Impact

✅ Complete lead data stored

✅ Industry data available for analytics

✅ Improved reporting accuracy
